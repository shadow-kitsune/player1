# Cybersecurity Journey
### 👋 Hi, I’m a Cybersecurity Enthusiast with Purpose and Persistence

I’ve been surrounded by technology since childhood — fixing old hardware, exploring systems, and helping others troubleshoot when no one else could. Growing up in a low-income household taught me the value of persistence, self-reliance, and long-term thinking. These experiences shaped who I am today: someone who is always learning, deeply thoughtful, and committed to meaningful work.

🛡 **Why Cybersecurity?**  
Cybersecurity combines everything I value — problem-solving, constant learning, and thinking critically under pressure. It’s not just a career path for me; it’s a mission to build a future where I can thrive doing what I love while making a real impact.

💡 **What I Bring to the Table:**
- **🧠 Deep Thinking:** I take a thoughtful, analytical approach to complex systems and security challenges.
- **🕰️ Patience:** I stay calm, focused, and persistent in solving problems and learning new skills.
- **💪 Perseverance:** I don't give up easily. Obstacles motivate me.
- **📚 Always Learning:** I constantly push to improve, grow, and stay ahead of cybersecurity threats.

🔍 **Currently Building Skills In:**
- Network Security
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Security+, CompTIA A+, Network+, Cloud+, & CISSP Certification Prep
- Linux, Scripting, Python, SQL, and System Fundamentals

📫 **Let’s Connect!**  
I’m looking to connect with professionals, mentors, and teams that value growth, curiosity, and a passion for protecting the digital world. Let’s build something meaningful together.
